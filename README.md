<h1>CORP VISION</h1>

<p>This is a website made from zero just with <b>html/css/sass/javascript</b></p>

<p>I have invest my effort this time in improve my skills with the pre-processor sass and making a more order architecture of sass files that let it the project be scalable, easy to manager (at least the styles and the html)</p>

<p>my priority with this project its to have more knowledge about css and sass.</p>
